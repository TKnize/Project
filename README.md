Recipe Indentifier

Dataset management sorts through visually identified ingredients to find viable recipes. Ingredients must be out of packaging for the convienence and simplicity of the algorithm.

## The Algorithm

A neuronal algorithm would use logic gates to identify ingredients based off of a hierachical outline of what do expect from certain classes of food. From here the data is transmitted from the ingredient database to identify variables then further extended to a recipe database to find viable recipes from matching the true ingredient variables to the recipe ingredient variable (, recipes could possibly be selective by criterea if time is available).
